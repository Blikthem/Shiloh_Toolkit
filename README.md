# clip-metagene
Suite of tools that use cluster files to visualize the binding of CLIP data across genomic features of a specified species.

# Longest Transcript Annotation
The metagene programs do not run directly from standard (GTF, RefFlat, etc.) annotation files but rather use an intermediate CSV file which contains information about the longest transcript splice varients of all genes for a species. This intermediate file is
